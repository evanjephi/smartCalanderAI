## Automated Test Scripts

### Example TypeScript Test (Future)

```typescript
import { parseBookingRequest } from '@/lib/aiParser';
import { createBookingSlots } from '@/lib/bookingEngine';

describe('SmartCalendar', () => {
  test('should parse simple meeting request', () => {
    const input = 'book meeting with Evan for Monday at 10:00-11:00 for December';
    const result = parseBookingRequest(input);
    
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result?.attendees).toContain('Evan');
    expect(result?.daysOfWeek).toContain('monday');
  });

  test('should create bookings for all Mondays', () => {
    const request = parseBookingRequest(
      'book with Evan for Monday at 10:00-11:00 for December'
    );
    const result = createBookingSlots(request!, mockUsers);
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.bookings.length).toBe(4); // Mondays in Dec
  });

  test('should reject invalid users', () => {
    const request = parseBookingRequest(
      'book with InvalidUser for Monday at 10:00-11:00'
    );
    const result = createBookingSlots(request!, mockUsers);
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(false);
    expect(result.message).toContain('No valid attendees');
  });
});
```

## Browser DevTools Testing

### Console Testing

```javascript
// Access the store from console
const store = window.__NEXT_DATA__;

// Check if bookings are created
console.log('Current bookings:', store);

// Verify state updates
```

### Network Tab

- No external API calls (local only)
- All data in-memory
- No backend latency

### Performance Tab

- Record performance during booking creation
- Check for jank or memory leaks
- Monitor rerender frequency

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No Conflict Detection**: Can overlap bookings (feature for future)
2. **No Persistence**: Data lost on refresh
3. **No Real API**: Uses mock data only
4. **Limited Parsing**: Regex-based, not ML
5. **No Timezone**: All times local
